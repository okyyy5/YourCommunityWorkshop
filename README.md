# YourCommunityWorkshop
A C# application that incorporates SQL Database Management through an external application.

### Description

This application's function is to provide the manipulation of database entries through a GUI. The scenario is, through this application, a small workshop will have to track the renting of tools, customer details, and tool details without managing the SQL queries and functions directly. Instead, employees and the employer will simply interact with a GUI.

There are search options in each menu to specifically find and filter an entry. The colour of the application can also be changed through the settings menu.

### Technologies Used

Developed in Visual Studio with The C# Programming Language.
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio was utilized for the database portion of the application.

The external package Dapper was utilized to manage the SQL queries and the sending of functions between the GUI and the SQL Database.

### How to Use and Install

The executable is located in YourCommunityWorkshopProject\YourCommunityWorkshop\bin\Release

However, this application was developed as a way to explore different aspects of development in C# and SQL, as such running the source code directly in a relevant environment is recommended. Either way an application that can manage an SQL Database must be utilized.

The application itself is self-explanatory. Navigate the menus, add, and delete entries to Customers, Tools, and Rentals when needed. Search functions are inserted to ease the task 
of locating specific entries. A Settings menu is provided to change the colour of the application.

To reset everything, delete the database manually after closing the application and run the application again.
